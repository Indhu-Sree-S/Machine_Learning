Abstract:
	Nowadays, Body health is more important for everyone. Even a small symptoms resultant into Various disease. Here we use the manual model, 
  (ie The person having those symptoms may have those disease) into the technical model as Disease Prediction. Disease Prediction is based 
  on predictive modeling predicts the disease of the user on the basis of the symptoms that user provides as an input. Analyses the symptoms 
  provided by the user as input and gives the probability of the disease as an output.


Task Description:
	Generate a model for the problem – Heart Disease Prediction. EDA was done for the data and now the data is clean. 

Code:
#splitting test and train
#Knn
#accuracy
Interpretation:
	We performed the knn classifier for this problem with k value 14. We run the KNN algorithm several times with different values of K and 
  choose the K that reduces the number of errors which is shown in the graph. The accuracy of this model is 80% 

#Randomforest
Interpretation:
	We performed Random forest classification for the given problem. Random forest classifier creates a set of decision trees from randomly 
  selected subset of training set. This model has the accuracy of 77%.

Training MSE : 0.0990566
Generalisation Error: 0.1978022

Interpretation:
	We performed a logistic Regression for the given problem. It’s Intercept and coefficients are given above. It has the accuracy of 80% , 
  training MSE as 0.099 and generalization error as 0.198.

Conclusion:
	Heart Disease Prediction problem is the type of classification problem, ie it shows that the patient with symptoms has heart disease or not. 
  We performed K nearest neighbor, Random forest and logistic regression to the given problem. Knn and logistic regression have the accuracy of 80%. 
  Knn model was generated by k=14 and also logistic regression have a minimum mean square error. Both the models are fit for this problem.
